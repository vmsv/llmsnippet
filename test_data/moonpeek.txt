Since June 11, 2024, we saw a distinct shift in the actor’s tactics with respect to setting up supporting infrastructure. After AhnLab’s disclosure, UAT-5394 moved from hosting their malicious payloads on legitimate cloud storage providers to systems and servers they now owned and controlled. It is likely that this move was made to preserve their infections from potential shutdown of cloud locations by the service providers. 
95[.]164[.]86[.]148 is one of the earliest servers set up and actively used by UAT-5394 since at least June 12, 2024, to host malicious artifacts (described in AhnLab’s disclosure) and served as a MoonPeak C2 server on Port 9999 until at least July 4, 2024. This C2 server was accessed between this time frame, over RDP by 27[.]255[.]81[.]118, another  UAT-5394 IOC resolving multiple malicious domains registered by the threat actors. 
On July 5, 2024, the threat actors now used 95[.]164[.]86[.]148 to RDP into a second malicious server, 167[.]88[.]173[.]173 which was already serving as a MoonPeak C2 on Port 9966. This RDP access to 167[.]88[.]173[.]173 resulted in a second deployment of MoonPeak’s C2 on Port 9936.
